              <p>Systems of relations – and thus networks – can be considered as the drivers of science, technology, and innovative change. Well-known examples of successful science, technology and innovation in networks originated in the electronics industries
                of Silicon Valley in California and Route 128 in Massachusetts; machine-tool, apparel and tile industries in northern Italy; the machine-tools and automotive industries of southern Germany; and others. Experience of the innovation leaders
                has shown, that multiple relational structures between organizations and individuals can provide high levels of diversity, and can be considered as the most favourable condition for knowledge creation as well as for the emergence and development
                of innovations. Networks allow their members to get access to diverse information and competencies, enhance organizational learning capabilities, reduce costs, and minimise risks (De Man 2008; Malerba 2009; Johnson 2009). Social network
                analysis allows understanding how the ties allowing collaborative research, technological breakthroughs, and innovation emerge and develop (Rogers 1962; Valente 1995; Powell et al. 1996; Pyka & Küppers 2002; Burt 2005; Tortoriello & Krackhardt
                2010). We invite well-grounded contributions based on the traditional social-network perspective that introduce new methods and techniques drawing on the established operationalizations.</p>
              <p>Whereas social network analysis has mainly focused on social agents and their relations (Freeman 2004), the network approach to science, technology, and innovation studies (STI) has been multimodal from the beginning. In science studies,
                “networks of scientific papers” (Price 1965) are organized intellectually at the above-individual level into journals and disciplines; in technology studies, “selection environments” (Nelson & Winter 1982) induce technological trajectories
                and regimes; and in innovation studies, the focus is on the non-linear interfaces between R&D and markets.</p>
              <p>Can the transversal dynamics of innovation be modeled using network analysis? Multimodal networks of what components should be analyzed: words, people, or perhaps ideas?</p>
              <p> What is evolving in the dynamics of these networks: industries, routines, technologies, markets? How can these multimodal networks be operationalized, both in terms of their complexity as interfaces at each moment of time, and in terms of
                changing priorities over time? How are the emerging developments socially constructed, and how do the constructs feedback on the constructors? What is the role of latent constructs such as regimes and disciplines? Papers dealing with these
                issues are particularly welcome. </p>
